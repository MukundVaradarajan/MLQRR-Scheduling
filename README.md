# MLQRR-Scheduling
Multi-Level Queue Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm which is a mix of SJF and Round Robin algorithms

A CLI based tool which simulates the MLQRR Scheduling algorithm
The tool simulates 5 to 10 processes at each run, randomizing burst times for each processes, 
then it applies the algorithm.
Bigger processes go into one queue where round robin scheduling is applied whereas smaller processes
are scheduled with SJF algorithm (Shortest Job First)
